## Overview

The Four Card Feature Section Challenge is a project from Frontend Mentor designed to help improve your coding skills through hands-on, realistic project experience. The challenge involves creating a four-card feature section with a specific layout.

Frontend Mentor provides the necessary style guide, including colors and fonts, along with a design file for reference. The challenge is to build this four-card feature section to look as close to the design as possible and function correctly.

This project presents an excellent opportunity to practice HTML and CSS skills, particularly focusing on layout and responsive design skills. Frontend Mentor encourages sharing your solutions on their platform, allowing you to get feedback from the community and see how others approached the same challenge.

The Four Card Feature Section Challenge is suitable for beginners looking to apply and reinforce their knowledge in a practical project or for more experienced developers looking to hone their skills with a quick, fun challenge.
